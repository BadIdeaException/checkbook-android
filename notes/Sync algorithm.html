	<h1>Database synchronization algorithm in Ledger</h1>
	<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		The application data as a whole is understood to be held in one or
		more
		<dfn>tables</dfn>
		, each of which is required to be uniquely identifiable. Data in them
		is organized
		<dfn>columns</dfn>
		, which must also be uniquely identifiable. Tables and their columns
		make up the structure of the application data (mapped to a relational
		database, this is a subset of the database schema). Thus, the number
		and identifiers of tables as well as the numbers and identifiers of
		columns within the tables are invariant across synchronizations.
	</p>
	<p>
		Within this structure, data is held in the form of
		<dfn>rows</dfn>
		and
		<dfn>values</dfn>
		. Each table may hold one or more rows, which intersect with all of
		that table's columns exactly once. Each of those intersections is
		occupied by at most one value. For ease of reference, a row is often
		also understood to refer to the whole of its values. Rows must also be
		uniquely identifiable. Their number is not invariant across
		synchronizations, but their identifier must be.
	</p>
	<table>
	<tr><td>table</td></tr>
	<tr><td>
	<table>
	<tr><td></td><td>column</td><td>column</td></tr>
	<tr><td>row</td><td>value</td><td>value</td></tr>
	<tr><td>row</td><td>value</td><td>value</td></tr>
	</table></td></tr>
	</table>
	<p>The following terminology is used within this document:</p>
	<div class="def">
		Let
		<ul>
			<li><span class="fml">row(v)</span> denote the unique identifier
				of the row within the database table holding a value <span
				class="fml">v</span>.</li>
			<li><span class="fml">column(v)</span> denote the column within
				the database table holding a value <span class="fml">v</span>.</li>
			<li><span class="fml">table(r)</span> denote the database table
				holding a row <span class="fml">r</span>. Where contextually
				appropriate, it will be understood to denote the database table of
				the row holding a value <span class="fml">v</span>, that is <span
				class="fml">table(v) = table(row(v))</span>.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p>
		Data within the application is changed through
		<dfn>operations</dfn>, of which there are exactly three types:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The <dfn>creation</dfn> of new rows within a table,
		</li>
		<li>the <dfn>updating</dfn> of a single value within a row, and
		</li>
		<li>the <dfn>deletion</dfn> of a row.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h2 id="journaling_of_operations">Journaling of operations</h2>
	<p>
		Clients are required to keep a
		<dfn>journal</dfn>
		detailing all operations performed on their data, such that, for any
		operation performed on the database, a corresponding entry in the
		journal can be found. This must include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A <dfn>sequence number</dfn> that is unique to the operation.
		</li>
		<li>An identifier of the table the operation was performed on.
			This could be the table name.</li>
		<li>An identifier of the row within the table that the operation
			was performed on, this could be its primary key.</li>
		<li>The type of operation that was performed. Possible values are
			<dfn>create</dfn>, <dfn>update</dfn> and <dfn>delete</dfn>
		<li>If the type of operation is <em>update</em>, an identifier of
			the table column that was updated. The new value need not be
			included.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Clients must also keep a record of the next sequence number to
		synchronize. This number is called the <dfn>sequence anchor</dfn>.</p>
	<p>The following terminology will be used within this document:</p>
	<div class="def">
		<ul>
			<li>For any operation <span class="fml">o</span>, let <span
				class="fml">sqn(o)</span> denote the sequence number of o.
			</li>
			<li>For any operation <span class="fml">o</span>, let <span
				class="fml">[o]</span> denote the data row or data value changed by
				<span class="fml">o</span>, whichever is applicable.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p>
		Sequence numbers must be ordered within the same journal such that for any operations <span
			class="fml">o</span> and <span class="fml">o'</span>, if <span
			class="fml">o</span> occurred before <span class="fml">o'</span> in
		time, then <span class="fml">sqn(o) &lt; sqn(o')</span>.
	</p>
	<h2 id="revision_awareness">Revision awareness</h2>
	<p>
		Clients are required to keep a
		<dfn>revision table</dfn>
		holding
		<dfn>revision numbers</dfn>
		for all values in the database. For a revision row <span
			class="fml">r</span> in the revision table holding the revision
		number for a data value <span class="fml">d</span>, <span class="fml">r</span>
		must include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>An identifier of the table the <span class="fml">d</span>
			resides in. This could be the table name.
		<li>An identifier of the row holding <span class="fml">d</span>
			within that table. This could be <span class="fml">d</span>'s primary
			key.
		</li>
		<li>An identifier of the column holding <span class="fml">d</span>
			within that table. This could be the column name.
		<li>The revision number of <span class="fml">d</span>.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The following terminology applies within this document:</p>
	<div class="def">
		<ul>
			<li>A (data) value <span class="fml">d</span> is said to be <dfn>in
					revision n</dfn>, from now on written as <span class="fml">r(d) =
					n</span>, when its corresponding row in the revision table has <span
				class="fml">n</span> as the value of its revision number column.
			</li>
			<li>A (data) row <span class="fml">D</span> is said to be <dfn>in
					revision n</dfn>, written as <span class="fml">r(D) = n</span>, when <span
				class="fml">r(d<sub>i</sub>) = n
			</span> for all values <span class="fml">d<sub>i</sub></span> in <span
				class="fml">D</span>, that is, when all the values in <span
				class="fml">D</span> are in revision <span class="fml">n</span>.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p>Newly created rows will be in revision 0. Any time operations on
		a row are successfully synchronized with the server, its revision
		number will be incremented. This is a responsibility of the server. (See subsection 
		<a href="#server_side_processing">server side processing</a>.)</p>
	<h2 id="synchronization">Synchronization</h2>
	<h3 id="client_side_preparations">Client side preparations</h3>
	<p>
		During synchronization, the synchronizing client will first determine
		the current sequence anchor <span class="fml">N</span>, 
		which it sends to the server. It then assembles from its
		journal <span class="fml">J</span>:
	<ul>
		<li>The set <span class="fml"><span class="large">C</span></span> of newly
			created rows, where <span class="fml"><span class="large">C</span> = <span class="large">{
				(</span>table([o]), [o]<span class="large">) |</span> o &isin; J with sqn(o) &geq; N <span class="large">}</span></span>.
			<br> This set consists of records holding the the table inserted into and the complete
			content of the inserted row. Note that the revision number is
			implicitly 0.
		</li>
		<li>The set <span class="fml"><span class="large">U</span></span> of updated
			values, where <span class="fml"><span class="large">U</span> = <span class="large">{
				(</span>table([o]), column([o]), [o], r([o])<span class="large">) |</span> o &isin; J
				with sqn(o) &geq; N <span class="large">}</span></span>. <br> This set consists of
			records holding the
			table and column of the updated value, the new value and the revision
			number of the value.
		</li>
		<li>The set <span class="fml"><span class="large">D</span></span> of deleted
			rows, where <span class="fml"><span class="large">D</span> = <span class="large">{
				(</span>table([o]), row([o]), r<sub>max</sub>([o])<span class="large">) |</span> o
				&isin; J with sqn(o) &geq; N <span class="large">}</span></span> <br> and <span
			class="fml">r<sub>max</sub>(X) = max(x<sub>i</sub>)
		</span> for all values <span class="fml">x<sub>i</sub></span> held by a row <span
			class="fml">X</span>, that is, <span class="fml">r<sub>max</sub>(X)
		</span> is the highest revision number for any of the values in <span
			class="fml">X</span>. <br> This set consists of records holding
			the table and unique row
			identifier of the deleted row, and the highest revision number of any
			value in the deleted row.
	</ul>
	It then transmits these to the server.
	</p>
	<h3 id="server_side_preparations">Server side preparations</h3>
	The server, using the sequence anchor
	<span class="fml">N</span> it received from the
	synchronizing client, assembles its own sets of created, updated and
	deleted rows
	<span class="fml"><span class="large">C</span><sub>S</sub></span>,
	<span class="fml"><span class="large">U</span><sub>S</sub></span> and
	<span class="fml"><span class="large">D</span><sub>S</sub></span> analogously to
	the definitions above, but using its own journal
	<span class="fml">J<sub>S</sub></span>.
	</p>
	<h3 id="server_side_processing">Server side processing</h3>
	<p>
		The server, upon receipt of <span class="fml"><span class="large">C</span></span>,
		<span class="fml"><span class="large">U</span></span> and <span class="fml"><span class="large">D</span></span>,
		now performs the following:
	<ul>
		<li>For any <span class="fml">(table([o]), [o]) &isin; <span class="large">C</span></span>,
			it carries out <span class="fml">o</span> (that is, inserts <span
			class="fml">[o]</span> into its own database), notes the execution of
			<span class="fml">o</span> in <span class="fml">J<sub>S</sub></span>
			and inserts a revision value of 1 for <span class="fml">[o]</span>
			into its own revision table. Note that a conflict can never occur.
		</li>
		<li>For any <span class="fml">(table([o]), column([o]),
				[o], r([o]))</span> where <span class="fml">o</span> is not in conflict
			with <span class="fml">J<sub>S</sub></span>, it carries out <span
			class="fml">o</span> (that is, it updates the value at <span
			class="fml">table([o]), row([o])</span> in its own database), notes
			the execution of <span class="fml">o</span> in <span class="fml">J<sub>S</sub></span>
			and increments the revision number of <span class="fml">[o]</span> in
			its revision table.
		</li>
		<li>For any <span class="fml">(table([o], row([o])) &isin;
				<span class="large">D</span>
		</span> where <span class="fml">o</span> is not in conflict with <span
			class="fml">J<sub>S</sub></span>, it carries out <span class="fml">o</span>
			(that is, it deletes <span class="fml">[o]</span> from its own
			database), notes the execution of <span class="fml">o</span> in <span
			class="fml">J<sub>S</sub></span> and increments the revision number
			of <span class="fml">[o]</span> in its revision table.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		A definition of conflicting operations and a description of resolution of operations 
		in conflict is given in the section <a
			href="#conflict_resolution">conflict resolution</a>. Note that for
		any operation <span class="fml">o</span> in conflict with <span
			class="fml">J<sub>S</sub></span>, there will by definition be a tuple
		for an operation <span class="fml">o'</span> in <span class="fml"><span class="large">C<sub>S</sub></span>
			&cup; <span class="large">U<sub>S</sub></span> &cup; <span class="large">D<sub>S</sub></span></span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		It then sends <span class="fml"><span class="large">C</span><sub>S</sub></span>, <span
			class="fml"><span class="large">U</span><sub>S</sub></span> and <span class="fml"><span class="large">D</span><sub>S</sub></span>
		to the client along with the new sequence anchor <span
			class="fml">N'</span>, where <span class="fml">N'
			= max(o' &isin; J<sub>S</sub>')
		</span> with <span class="fml">J<sub>S</sub>'
		</span> being the server-side journal after adding all the operations from <span
			class="fml"><span class="large">C</span></span>, <span class="fml"><span class="large">U</span></span>
		and <span class="fml"><span class="large">D</span></span>, in other words, the
		next available sequence number the client can use to log any future
		operations after this synchronization (because this will also be the
		first operation to sync on the next synchronization).
	</p>
	<h3 id="client_side_processing">Client side processing</h3>
	<p>
		The client, upon receipt of
		<span class="fml"><span class="large">C</span><sub>S</sub></span>
		,
		<span class="fml"> <span class="large">U</span><sub>S</sub></span>
		and
		<span class="fml"> <span class="large">D</span><sub>S</sub></span>
		carries out steps analogous to those performed by the server. However,
		the following differences apply:
	<ol>
		<li>It performs <em>all</em> operations it receives regardless of
			whether they are in conflict with its journal <span class="fml">J</span> or not.
			Therefore it does not need to perform conflict checking.
		</li>
		<li>Revision numbers are not incremented as they are server-side,
			but instead set to the values transmitted by the server.</li>
		<li>Even though it may write the execution of the received
			operations to <span class="fml">J</span>, it is not required to do so. If it does,
			it must make sure to not exceed the new sequence anchor <span class="fml">N'</span>.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Having done so, it increments the revision number for any value
	<span class="fml">[o]</span>
	from
	<span class="fml"> <span class="large">C</span> &cup; <span class="large">U</span> &cup; <span class="large">D</span></span>
	for which there is not a conflicting operation in
	<span class="fml"><span class="large">C<sub>S</sub></span> &cup; <span class="large">U<sub>S</sub></span>
		&cup; <span class="large">D<sub>S</sub></span></span>. Informally, this might be
	described as follows: For any of its "own" operations, it will
	increment the revision number, unless they were overruled by a
	server-sent operation, in which case it will set the revision number to
	that indicated by the server (as indeed with all server-sent
	operations). Finally, it updates the sequence anchor to be the value
	<span class="fml">N'</span>	received from the server.
	</p>
	<h2 id="conflict_resolution">Conflict resolution</h2>
	Conflicts arise from operations on the same values (or rows) being made
	indepently from each other on the server and client. The following
	types are possible (where "remote" denotes operations on the server and
	"local" operations on the client):
	<table>
		<tr class="caption">
			<td />
			<td>Remote creation</td>
			<td>Remote update</td>
			<td>Remote deletion</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="caption">Local creation</td>
			<td>Cannot happen</td>
			<td>Cannot happen</td>
			<td>Cannot happen</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="caption">Local update</td>
			<td>Cannot happen</td>
			<td>Conflict possible</td>
			<td>Conflict possible</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="caption">Local deletion</td>
			<td>Cannot happen</td>
			<td>Conflict possible</td>
			<td>Can happen, but won't conflict</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	Two problematic scenarios can be identified: update-update conflicts,
	where a value was changed independently on the client and server, and
	delete-update conflicts, where a value was updated by one side and
	deleted by the other. Formally,
	<div class="def">
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Update-update conflict: </strong>An update operation
				<span class="fml">o</span> is <dfn>in conflict</dfn> with an update operation <span class="fml">o'</span>
				if <span class="fml">table([o]) = table([o'])</span> and <span
				class="fml">column([o]) = column([o'])</span> and <span class="fml">row([o])
					= row([o'])</span> and <span class="fml">r([o] &lt; r([o']))</span> and <span
				class="fml">sqn(o') &geq; N</span>.</li>
			<li><strong>Delete-update conflict: </strong>A delete operation
				<span class="fml">o</span> is <dfn>in conflict</dfn> with an update operation <span class="fml">o'</span>
				if <span class="fml">table(o) = table(o')</span> and <span class="fml">row(o) = row(o')</span>
				and <span class="fml">r([o]) &lt; max(r[o']<sub>i</sub>)</span> for any value <span class="fml">[o']<sub>i</sub></span>
				in <span class="fml">[o']</span> and <span class="fml">sqn(o') &geq; N</span>.</li>
			<li>An operation <span class="fml">o &notin; J<sub>S</sub></span>
				is <dfn>in conflict</dfn> with <span class="fml">J<sub>S</sub></span>
				if there is an entry in for an operation <span class="fml">o'</span>
				in <span class="fml">J<sub>S</sub></span> that <span class="fml">o</span>
				is in conflict with.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	</p>
	<p>
		The server deals with both conflict types identically: by rejecting
		the operation offered by the client. Thus, for any operation
		<span class="fml">o</span>
		that is in conflict with the server's journal
		<span class="fml">J<sub>S</sub></span>
		, the server will not carry out any of the steps described in
		subsection <a href="#server_side_processing">server side
			processing</a>, effectively discarding
		<span class="fml">o</span>
		and superseding it with the conflicting operation from
		<span class="fml">J<sub>S</sub></span>
		.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that client-sent revision numbers can never be greater than
		server-side ones&mdash;they can only be less (if the client was
		working on outdated data) or equal. This is because they are only set
		on synchronization, where both sides will increment by one, and
		because for any operations rejected by the server because of
		conflicts, the conflicting operation will be included in <span
			class="fml"><span class="large">C<sub>S</sub></span> &cup; <span class="large">U<sub>S</sub></span>
			&cup; <span class="large">D<sub>S</sub></span></span>.
	</p>
	<h2 id="preventing_partial_synchronizations">Preventing partial
		synchronizations</h2>
	Interruption in mid-process is an inherent risk of synchronization over
	an unreliable medium. For battery-operated clients, there is the
	additional risk of the client running out of power during
	synchronization. Precautions must be taken to ensure that an
	interrupted synchronization can never lead to inconsistent states on
	either side.
	<h3>Interruption during client side preparations</h3>
	<p>During this phase, no changes are made to either side's data store. This
	is therefore a non-issue; it will simply keep the synchronization from
	being carried out at this time.</p>
	<h3>Message loss after client side preparations</h3>
	<p>This will have the same effects as interruption during client side preparations.</p>
	<h3>Interruption during server side preparations</h3>
	<p>For analogous reasons as those given for interruption during client
	side preparations, this is also a non-issue, with the same effects as
	those stated there.</p>
	<h3>Interruption during server side processing</h3>
	<p>Interruption during server side processing is safe provided it does not happen
	between execution of an operation <span class="fml">o</span> and modification of the revision number
	pertaining to <span class="fml">[o]</span>. </p>
	<p>Interruption at any other point will simply result in not all client data being
	incorporated into the server side data store. Since a new sequence anchor 
	has not been transmitted to the client, on the next synchronization, 
	it will re-transmit all operations (formally: a superset of 
	<span class="fml"> <span class="large">C</span> &cup; <span class="large">U</span> &cup; <span class="large">D</span></span>), 
	the already synchronized operations of which the server will discard because of outdated revision numbers.</p>
	<p>Repercussions from interruption during this phase can be alleviated by wrapping 
	its operations in a single transaction, which will then be carried out atomically.
	Nevertheless, the database should be backed up regularly so as to guard against 
	catastrophic failures such as power loss during transaction commit.</p>     
	<h3>Message loss after server side processing</h3>
	<p>This is safe, as server data is guaranteed to be in a consistent state at this point
	(all operations and revision number adjustments have been made). Losing the message
	containing <span class="fml"> <span class="large">C<sub>S</sub></span></span>, 
	<span class="fml"><span class="large">U<sub>S</sub></span></span>, <span class="fml"><span class="large">D<sub>S</sub></span></span> and
	<span class="fml">N'</span> will simply result in the client pushing all of its already
	processed operations again on the next synchronization, which the server will
	discard due to outdated revision numbers.
	<h3>Interruption during client side processing</h3>
	<p>As with server side processing, this can result in an inconsistent state if interruption
	occurs between execution of an operation and the associated update of the revision 
	number of the row or value in question. Similarly, interruption at any other time is
	safe in terms of data consistency. 
	There is however a scenario that can lead to user data being lost if an interruption
	occurs before the sequence anchor has been updated on the client. 
	This happens when operations sent by the server have been incorporated into the client
	data store, but because the sequence anchor has not been updated
	these operations will be downloaded again on the next synchronization. Because server-
	sent operations are incorporated unquestioned, changes made by the user to the 
	downloaded data will be overwritten on the next synchronization. While these user 
	changes will be pushed to the server on that next synchronization, because of the low
	sequence anchor <span class="fml">N</span>, they will conflict with the server-side
	operation causing the download in the first place, and consequently be discarded 
	by the server.</p>
	<p>As with server side processing, the implications of this can be managed by wrapping the 
	operations in a transaction, performing regular backups, and denying synchronization
	when the device is already low on power.</p> 
	<h2 id="optimizations">Optimizations</h2>
	<h3 id="client_side_optimizations">Client side optimizations</h3>
	<p>To reduce journal size as well as the number of journaled operations to send to the server, 
	a number of optimizations can be made to client side journaling. All operations in the 
	following are implicitly understood to have sequence numbers <span class="fml">&geq; N</span>.
	<ol>
	<li>For a create operation <span class="fml">o</span> followed by an update operation <span class="fml">o'</span> with
	<span class="fml">table([o]) = table([o']) &and; row([o]) = row([o'])</span>, <span class="fml">o'</span> need not be
	written to the journal.</li> 
	<li>For an update operation <span class="fml">o</span> followed by an update operation <span class="fml">o'</span> with
	<span class="fml">table([o]) = table([o']) &and; row([o]) = row([o']) &and; column([o]) = column([o'])</span>,
	it is enough if one of those operations is written to the journal (preferably the first).</li>
	<li>For any create or update operation <span class="fml">o</span> followed by a delete operation <span class="fml">o'</span> with
	<span class="fml">table([o]) = table([o']) &and; row([o]) = row([o'])</span>, <span class="fml">o</span> can be removed from 
	the journal. If <span class="fml">o</span> was a create operation, then <span class="fml">o'</span> is to be omitted from the journal.
	</ol></p>
	<h3 id="server_side_optimizations">Server side optimizations</h3>
	<p>In theory, the server side journal lends itself to the same optimizations as those outlined in the previous
	subsection, however, this only applies in those stretches of its journal that have never been
	synchronized by <strong>any</strong> client. 
	Formally, this means that the operations <span class="fml">o</span> and <span class="fml">o'</span>
	as outlined above are required to also satisfy the constraint that there is no client with 
	a sequence anchor <span class="fml">N<sub>C</sub></span> for which
	<span class="fml">sqn(o) &lt; N<sub>C</sub> &and; sqn(o') &geq; N<sub>C</sub></span>.</p>
	<p>To further optimize the server side, it is also possible to leave out those operations 
	satisfying the constraints outlined in the previous subsection while assembling the server side
	sets <span class="fml"><span class="large">C<sub>S</sub></span></span>, <span class="fml"><span class="large">U<sub>S</sub></span></span> and
	<span class="fml"><span class="large">D<sub>S</sub></span></span>. This puts more strain on the server during
	the server side preparation phase, but does reduce the size of the message sent to the client.
	<h2>Limitations</h2>
	This algorithm does not lend itself to concurrent synchronizations by multiple clients.
